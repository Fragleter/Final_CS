##This file contains the main code for our app.
##Idea: As sustainability and health are becoming of interest to more and more people, we wanted to create an app that would help users get into gardening, growing their own fruits and vegetables, in a simple and effective way.
##How it works: Based on the input provided by the user, the app provides the best-suited crop recommendation. Additional general information and tips are provided for the recommended crop.
##With the given location, we find the current weather data (temperature and humidity) using the Open Meteo API and recommend crops accordingly.

import datetime as dt ##Used to get the current date and time
import pickle ##Used to save and load the machine learning model
import numpy as np ##Used for numerical operations (mathematical part)
import requests ##Used for HTTP requests to the Open Meteo API for the necessary weather data
import streamlit as st ##Used for creating and visualizing the web app

from kl import display_care_recommendations ##Importing the functions to display care recommendations (after output, i.e. recommended crop)

##Resources and help:
## - CS Coaching tutors: help with finding datasets, checking whether they are usable for our project, and so on.
## - Friends and relatives: help with code structure, debugging and fixing mistakes or problems.
## - AI:
##       - ChatGPT and Claude: help with code structure, debugging and corrections or improvements, finding functions or code snippets to use for what we wanted to implement, research on plant care information and tips, and so on.
##       - Github Copilot: automatic suggestions, improving code, fixing problems and errors, and so on.
## - Greg.app: Research and information to use for the plant care recommendations and tips section (see kl.py and plant_care_database.json).
## - Kaggle: finding datasets and examples of similar projects.
## - Open Meteo API: getting the weather data (current temperature and humidity) based on the user's location.
