Main .py File:
##This file contains the main code for our app.
##Idea: As sustainability and health are becoming of interest to more and more people, we wanted to create an app that would help users get into gardening, growing their own fruits and vegetables, in a simple and effective way.
##Resources and help:
- CS Coaching tutors: help with finding datasets, checking whether they are usable for our project, and so on.
- Friends and relatives: help with code structure, debugging and fixing mistakes or problems.
- AI:
  - ChatGPT and Claude: help with code structure, debugging and corrections or improvements, finding functions or code snippets to use for what we wanted to implement, research on plant care information and tips, and so on.
  - Github Copilot: automatic suggestions, improving code, fixing problems and errors, and so on.
- Greg.app: Research and information to use for the plant care recommendations and tips section (see kl.py and plant_care_database.json).
- Kaggle: finding datasets and examples of similar projects.
- Open Meteo API: getting the weather data (current temperature and humidity) based on the user's location.

ML_Test.py:
- Friends and family: help understanding basic ml concepts, help creating a structure for our code, advice on what 
algorithms to test/use, help finding suitable functions or code snippets to use for what we wanted to implement, 
corrections, help with fixing errors and problems, proof reading and so on.
- CS Coaching tutors: advice on dataset quality and usability, overall feedback.
- AI (Github Copilot, ChatGPT and Claude): help understanding basic ml concepts, help finding suitable functions to 
use for what we wanted to implement, help with errors and problems, corrections, help finding structures of blocks 
for what we wanted to implement, providing improvements and so on.
